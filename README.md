We have developed a book selling website using node js and sql database,where we can 
sell old books and buy one at cheaper cost.
The online bookstore software project acts as a central database containing various books in stock along with the
title,author,cost and rating. A user visiting website can see a wide range of books arranged in respective 
categories. User can also sell their old book at good price. This website is made especially for the colleges where 
students can buy books from senior or another student who no longer needs the book. On our website the user 
can put the book detail along with their detail so that anyone who want to get can contact them and buy.
